This package for Sublime Text provides the hover preview popups for images and CSS colors from Adobe Brackets.

The design of the hover popups is intended to reproduce the style of the Quick View feature from Brackets, but it uses adaptive colors dependent on the color scheme and the plugin logic was written from scratch.

Also try out my [Brackets Color Scheme](https://github.com/jwortmann/brackets-color-scheme) package for Sublime Text if you like.

## Installation

The package can be installed via Sublime Text's package manager [Package Control](https://packagecontrol.io/installation).
From the command palette select `Package Control: Install Package` and search for *QuickView*.
